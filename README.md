MCU Arena Text-Based Fighting Game With Marvel Characters

## Description:
This is a text-based fighting game that revolves around the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters, including the franchise characters and villains, they will have their items and abilities. The characters will be split into 2 teams: the heroes and the villains. But we will have 3 different types of characters, the Heroes, the Anti-Heroes, and the Villains, the only twist here is that Anti-heroes can be both on the Heroes team or the Villain team.

## How To Run the Program, How it works:
This game will start with a main menu that has 2 options. The user can pick between Play and Quit, type the number correlating to each choice and enter. Picking quit will terminate the program. Picking Play will direct the user to another menu that has more options to pick from. In order to start the game the user will have to pick to join between the 2 teams, they can either join the Heroes Team or the Villian Team, but before they pick any of these 2 options they have another option to inspect the teams "View Teams". This will show the user the team lists and the characters. Once the user picks the team they want to be in they can pick 3 characters from the list to be on their team. To choose each character to be placed on their team they must type the characters name and enter. do this for three characters (will be specified in the code)

Once that process is done the game will start. The game will progress in rounds style, each with many fight-offs. At the start of each fight, the game will tell the user which character they are going against, and it's random. (The game will show the stats of the character the user will fight). After that, the user will pick a character from their team that can beat the character. If the current character is struggling and users wish to switch, they can switch characters at the next fight-offs, the fight-offs only end when both characters from the 2 teams have dealt damage or fought at least once.

The game will end with the team with the best performance in 3 rounds, they fight till they drop each round. Each round can be won in different and multiple fight-offs, just make sure to win most of the fight-offs and have the most characters alive at the end of the round you will win the round. Each round will consist of 16 fight-offs.

## About the Characters & Game Logic:
All characters' max level is 50.

All characters gain a random XP from 2-5 on every attack they do on the opposing team, and they need 10 XP to level up. If they manage to kill a character from the opposing team, they will level up instantly.

All characters' passive attacks will increase with their level, each level plus 0.5 damage to their passive attack and 2 damage to their critical attack. Critical damage happens every third attack or at a random time for all characters.

All characters’ ultimate attacks will increase with their level as well, plus 10 damage to their ultimate attack every time they level up.

All character’s defense and health will increase with their level. Each time they level up plus 10 to their health and 5 to their defense.
